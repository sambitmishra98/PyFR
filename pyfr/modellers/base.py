# Idea

# Given what we observe and what the cost is, we make our model.
# Types of models over which we can optimise:
# 0. Linear Regression
# 1. Gaussian Process Model (Followed by Bayesian Optimisation)
# 2. RNN (Optimising the weights of the RNN)
# 3. LSTM (Optimising the weights of the LSTM)
# 4. CNN (Optimising the weights of the CNN)

# This class will serve as the base for making model, 
# over which further optimisation is done.
